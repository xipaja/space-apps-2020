# NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2020
Hey! What Are You Looking At? Challenge: To create a visualization tool that can help people interested in high-energy astrophysics phenomena to access the data quickly and easily.

# Project summary
We developed a web app to visualize HEASARC data, where a user can select a mission and view a relevant dataset through either a 3D visualization. We also provide the option for the user to see the data in a table format, as provided by HEASARC. This option is more for professional scientists who prefer to visualize and study the data in table format, and this option is easily chosen by a toggle on the interface. Common data types, such as Name, RA, Dec, BII, and LII are visible on the interface during both visualization and table mode. Our project was inspired by data from the Swift Observatory, provided by HEASARC. We also found a data set about how objects seen from Swift changed over time, and that inspired our delta visualization.
